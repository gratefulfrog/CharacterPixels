# Usage
- **Mouse click** will toggle the display of the underlying image,
- **'+' key** will start incrementing the number of squares on the checkerboard
- **'-' key** will start decrementing the number of squares on the checkerboard
- **Any other key** will pause the inc/decrementing

# Notes
 - Rounding errors can cause wrong colored pixels!
 - current version uses individual character bounding boxes to sample the underlying image and average the result.
