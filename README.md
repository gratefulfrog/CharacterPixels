# Usage
## Checkerboard Demo
- **Mouse click** will toggle the display of the underlying image,
- **'+' key** will start incrementing the number of squares on the checkerboard
- **'-' key** will start decrementing the number of squares on the checkerboard
- **'t' or 'T' keys** will toggle use of true or standard character bounding box for character color computation, the type of box is displayed in the console.
- **'r' or 'R' keys** will toggle use of filled rectangle to replace the ' ' space character
- **Any other key** will pause the inc/decrementing

## Rotating Iguana Demo
- **Mouse click** will toggle the display of the underlying image,
- **'t' or 'T' keys** will toggle use of true or standard character bounding box for character color computation, the type of box is displayed in the console.
- **'r' or 'R' keys** will toggle use of filled rectangle to replace the ' ' space character
- **Any other key** will pause the rotation


# Notes
 - The space character has no fill color so it shows the background; this could be changed if needed.
